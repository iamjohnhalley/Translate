GitHib repo https://github.com/iamjohnhalley/Translate


I integrated my application with GitHub by forking to the starter project. I then downloaded a local copy to my computer. I completed the required functionality such as wiring up outlets to UI components, added a further two destination languages and implemented a UIPicker view to select between languages. 

Design & features

-	Updated colour scheme using the adobe colour scheme - https://color.adobe.com/
-	Updated the activity inspector to suit the look of the application
-	Designed a simplistic App icon in all sizes 
-	Created a splash screen which will give users the impression the app is almost loaded.
-	Created round edges on the UItext Views and the translation button to give a friendlier feel to the UI
-	I added auto layout to the application 

Extra feature

For my extra feature I added a speech reader to the. This will allow users to read out their translation in the chosen language.
