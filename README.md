Assignment 1

I forked with the starter project on Moodle and downloaded a local copy to my computer. I completed the required functionality such as wiring up outlets to UI components, added a further two destination languages and implemented a UIPicker view to select between languages. 

Design & features

-	I Updated colour scheme using the adobe colour scheme - https://color.adobe.com/
-	I Updated the activity inspector to suit the look of the application using the IJProgressView found on GitHub https://github.com/Isuru-Nanayakkara/IJProgressView 
I  then customised this progress view to suit my app
-	I updated the keyboard to resign when the return key is pressed and also when a user clicks anyway from the keyboard. 

-	I added placeholder text to the translation textView.

-	I then designed a simplistic App icon in all sizes following the apple design principles.
-	I Created a splash screen which will give users the impression the app is almost loaded.
-	I Created round edges on the UItext Views and the translation button to give a friendlier feel to the UI
-	I added auto layout to the application 
-	I Updated the NSURLConnec+on.sendAsynchronousRequest() depreciated code to session
- 	I also updated the status bar changing its colour to white to suit the background colours of the app more.



Extra feature

For my extra feature I added a speech reader.  This will allow users to read out their translation in their chosen language.
